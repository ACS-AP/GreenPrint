# GreenPrint
GreenPrint is a website created to showcase an application idea called GreenPrint.
GreenPrint is an application that will allow users to boldly view their monthly 
household consumption. With this data we can provide users with comparisons, solutions
and more. You can view the website on github pages at https://arnavpag.github.io/GreenPrint/

The website is divided into 4 sections. Home, About, Features, Contact

Home

The Home sectiom is an image with a mountain range with the GreenPrint logo edited on top.

The About section has the What, Why and How of GreenPrint, relaying a brief overview to the user.
It includes images I created and JS animation. The about also includes a value and timing sections
below.

Features

The Features section talks about 4 features which I thought were absolutely neccesary to include 
for this application

Contact

The Contact section is a simplistic constact form. 

The website uses HTML, CSS, JS and JS animation library.
